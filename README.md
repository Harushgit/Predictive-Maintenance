# ğŸ”§ Predictive Maintenance & Engine Health Classification â€“ Dash + ML

This project delivers a comprehensive **Predictive Maintenance solution** using multiple **Machine Learning models** and the **NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Dataset**. It predicts the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)**, estimates **30-day failure probabilities**, and performs **engine health classification** via an interactive **Dash web app**.

## ğŸ“Œ Key Features

- ğŸ§  Uses various ML models for accurate RUL prediction
- ğŸ“‰ Predicts failure probability over the next 30 days
- ğŸ“Š Classifies engines into health categories based on life ratio
- ğŸ“ˆ Visualizes trends, forecasts, and classifications in a Dash app
- âš¡ Interactive & responsive user interface for exploration

## ğŸš€ Project Goals

- Predict **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** for each engine unit
- Estimate **failure probability** over a defined future horizon (30 days)
- Classify engines based on **life ratio buckets**
- Provide a role-based dashboard for **engineers, analysts, and operations teams**

## ğŸ“‚ Dataset

**Source**: NASAâ€™s CMAPSS â€“ Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Dataset  
**Data Includes**:
- Engine ID, cycle count
- Sensor readings (21+ features)
- Operational settings
- Actual failure time for supervised learning

> Data was preprocessed and used to compute target labels for:
> - RUL (continuous regression)
> - Failure Probability (per day)
> - Life Ratio Classification (low, medium, high risk)
